# euphros-website
My personnal website

** Still under construction, wanted to see how it rendered live on github pages **

fixed the horizontal overflow... now working on the form redirection after submissions.

Some pages are missing right now, and the text is not corrected at all for now, might be up or down depending if i am working on it right now or not.

** The lorem ipsum filled sections are because i am currently designing / working on those sections so it not final **

I am also working on a french version since i am based in quebec, Canada.
