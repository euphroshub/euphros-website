# euphros-website
My personnal website

** Still underconstruction, wanted to see how it rendered live on github pages **

Some pages are missing right now, and the text is not corrected at all for now, might be up or down depending if i am working on it right now or not.

I am also working on a french version since i am based in quebec, Canada.
